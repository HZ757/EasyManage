# EasyManage
A company managing tool designed to be used by small companies. A project created for the Internal Assessment of IB Higher Level Computer Science

The goal of my product is to make it easier and minimize the time to organize our small company’s departments, employees and tasks. It would maximize the efficiency of the president’s management of the company. As well, it would give the president a way to give tasks, change the departments of the company and make it easier to contact employees in order to manage them. 
 
I choose to write the program in Java in the IDE BlueJ because I was experienced in the language. 
 
The program should be able to display all the departments of the company, with the option to customize the names and number of each department. When a department is selected, the tasks and employees of the department are shown, with the tasks showing the name, description, deadline and status, while the employees show their name, role, phone number and email information.
